# MacOS_Scripting_Library
This repository serves as a collection of bash / shell scripts that were developped for MacOS (minimum OS level: Mojave 10.14.6).


# Environments
The usage and results of these scripts may vary depending on your infrastructure versionning.
Each script is documented on how it should be used.
Below are the supported systems:
* MacOS Mojave (beginning 10.14.6)
* MacOS Catalina (all versions)
* MacOS BigSur (all versions)
* MacOS Monterey (all versions)
* MacOS Ventura (all versions)
* HackinTosh (to be tested)

In some cases, youmight need to allow osascript to take some actions on first launch.
